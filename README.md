# simgame
Simulation-type game

Eventually we should probably make this README more robust. Ideally it should explain things like, what this project is/does, how to run it, where we're at in the development process, maybe some general long long term goals.

To start:

This project is a life/battle/survival simulation game (genre not pinned down yet?) implemented in Python using the PyGame library. It's the first time for both of us making an actual game so there's going to be some bumps in the development. Plus it's a hobby project for both of us so development will usually take a backseat to the whole work-life balance thing.
Development is in the beginning stage so to run the game you actually have to have Python (version?) and PyGame installed on your system. At some point we can look into how to make an executable so everyone can run the game easily.
What we want the game to be, will probably evolve over time as we run into challenges.
